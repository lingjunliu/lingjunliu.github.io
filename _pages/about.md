I am a second-year PhD student at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. Marcelo d'Amorim in the SWAT research group. My research focuses on software testing with the goal of making software systems more reliable.
Currently, I am working on developing and optimizing testing techniques for C compilers such as GCC and Clang.
