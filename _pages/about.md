I am a second-year PhD student at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. Marcelo d'Amorim in the SWAT research group. My research focuses on software testing with the goal of making software systems more reliable.
Currently, I am working on developing and optimizing testing techniques for C compilers such as GCC and Clang.

Prior to starting my PhD at NC State, I earned my M.S. from KAIST under the supervision of Prof. Doo-Hwan Bae. My research interests lie in software testing, fault diagnosis, software reliability, cyber-physical systems, and safety-critical systems. During my master's, I developed mutation-based test generation techniques for nuclear power plant software using SMT solvers. For more details, see the publications section.
